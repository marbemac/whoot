  <h1>The Whoot Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    <span>1. Information you provide to us:</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Information About Yourself.</span> When you sign up for The Whoot you provide us with information you have provided to Facebook. During the registration process we give you the opportunity to connect with your Facebook friends. You will also be able to add a picture of yourself. In some cases we may ask for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you. Once you register you can provide other information about yourself by connecting with, for example, your current city or college.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Content.</span> One of the primary reasons people use The Whoot is to share content with others. Examples include when you update your post, upload a photo, create an Open Invitation, make a comment, tag your night, recommend deals etc… If you do not want us to store metadata associated with content you share on The Whoot (such as photos), please remove the metadata before uploading the content.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Transactional Information.</span> We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on The Whoot. All information will be kept securely and will not under any circumstances be redistributed. Transactional information is kept strictly for the benefit of return users making repeat transactions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Friend Information.</span> We offer contact importer tools to help you upload your friends’ addresses so that you can find your friends on The Whoot, and invite your contacts who do not have The Whoot accounts to join. If you give us your password to retrieve those contacts, we will not store your password after you have uploaded your contacts’ information.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Information we collect when you interact with The Whoot:</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Site activity information.</span> We keep track of some of the actions you take on The Whoot, such as adding connections (adding a friend), pinging another user, indicating you “like” a post, attending an invite, or liking a deal.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Access Device and Browser Information.</span> When you access The Whoot from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Cookie Information.</span> We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to make The Whoot easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and The Whoot. For example, we use them to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to The Whoot. We also use them to confirm that you are logged into The Whoot, and to know when you are interacting with The Whoot Platform applications and websites, our widgets and Share buttons, and our advertisements. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use The Whoot.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Information we receive from third parties:</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Information from other websites.</span> We may institute programs with advertising partners and other websites in which they share information with us:
    We may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison purposes, how other users who didn’t see the ads acted on their site). This data sharing, commonly known as “conversion tracking,” helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements you see.
    We may receive information about whether or not you’ve seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in order to measure the effectiveness of those ads.
  </p>



  <p>
    <span>2. Sharing information on The Whoot.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    This section explains how your privacy settings work, and how your information is shared on The Whoot. You should always consider your privacy settings before sharing information on The Whoot.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Name and Profile Picture.</span> The Whoot is designed to make it easy for you to find out the plans of your friends and gain access to money saving hot spots in your city. For this reason, your name and profile picture do not have privacy settings. If you are uncomfortable with sharing your profile picture, you should delete it (or not add one).
    Other. All posts, comments and other actions taken on the The Whoot are fully viewable by all those who follow you. The only thing that is 100% anonymous is who you have PINGed on any given day.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Blocking Users.</span> The Whoot allows users to block other users. In doing so, blocked users will not be able to find, follow, or see any actions taken by you on The Whoot. Essentially, if you block a user, it will be as if you do not exist on the site.
  </p>


  <p>
    <span>3. Information You Share With Third Parties.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Advertisements.</span> Sometimes the advertisers who present ads on The Whoot use technological methods to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. You may also use your browser cookie settings to limit or prevent the placement of cookies by advertising networks. The Whoot does not share personally identifiable information with advertisers unless we get your permission.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Links.</span> When you click on links on The Whoot you may leave our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites, and we encourage you to read their privacy statements.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>4. How We Use Your Information</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on how we do that:
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>To manage the service.</span> We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support. We use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities. We also use a variety of technological systems to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>To contact you.</span> We may contact you with service-related announcements from time to time. You may opt out of all communications except essential updates on your account settings page. We may include content you see on The Whoot in the emails we send to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>To serve personalized advertising to you.</span> We don’t share your information with advertisers without your consent. We allow advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements and we may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. For example, we might use the fact that you are “staying in” to show you ads for local delivery restaurants, but we do not tell the restaurants who you are. Even though we do not share your information with advertisers without your consent, when you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they selected.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>To serve social ads.</span> We occasionally pair advertisements we serve with relevant information we have about you and your friends to make advertisements more interesting and more tailored to you and your friends. We only share the personally identifiable information visible in the social ad with the friend who can see the ad.
  </p>


  <p>
    <span>5. How We Share Information</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Whoot is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your communities — while providing you with privacy settings that you can use to restrict other users from accessing some of your information.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>When you invite a friend to join.</span> When you ask us to invite a friend to join The Whoot, we will send your friend a message on your behalf using your name. We may also send up to two reminders to them in your name.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>When you choose to share your information with marketers.</span> You may choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers that are not associated with The Whoot through on-site offers. This is entirely at your discretion and we will not provide your information to these marketers without your consent.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>To advertise our services.</span> We may ask advertisers outside of The Whoot to display ads promoting our services. We may ask them to deliver those ads based on the presence of a cookie, but in doing so will not share any other information with the advertiser.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>To offer joint services.</span> We may provide services jointly with other companies. If you use these services, we may share your information to facilitate that service.
  </p>

  <p>
    Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control. If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>6. How We Protect Information</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Risks inherent in sharing information.</span> Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on The Whoot will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on The Whoot. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Report Violations.</span> You should report any security violations to us.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>7. Other Terms</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>Changes.</span> We may change this Privacy Policy at any time for the reason of creating a better service for our users. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by publication on The Whoot. If the changes are material, we will provide you additional, prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances.
  </p>

  <p>
    Consent to Collection and Processing in the United States. By using The Whoot, you consent to having your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.
